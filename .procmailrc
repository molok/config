# SpamAssassin 
# ==============================

# The following line is only used if you use a system-wide /etc/procmailrc.
# See procmailrc(5) for infos on what it exactly does, the short version:
#  * It ensures that the correct user is passed to spamd if spamc is used
#  * The folders the mail is filed to later on is owned by the user, not
#    root.
DROPPRIVS=yes

# Pipe the mail through spamassassin (replace 'spamassassin' with 'spamc'
# if you use the spamc/spamd combination)
#
# The condition line ensures that only messages smaller than 250 kB
# (250 * 1024 = 256000 bytes) are processed by SpamAssassin. Most spam
# isn't bigger than a few k and working with big messages can bring
# SpamAssassin to its knees.
#
# The lock file ensures that only 1 spamassassin invocation happens
# at 1 time, to keep the load down.

# Mails with a score of 15 or higher are almost certainly spam (with 0.05%
